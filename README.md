# Regularization
In this assignment, you will work with a dataset that includes The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. The target variable of interest in this dataset is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV), which serves as a proxy for the house prices.
First, you will start by fitting a basic regression model using scikit-learn (sklearn) to establish a baseline for comparison. This basic regression model will serve as a reference point for evaluating the performance of more sophisticated models incorporating regularization techniques.

Furthermore, you will apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques to refine your predictions and evaluate the impact of these methods on the accuracy of your results. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging simpler models with smaller coefficients. L1 regularization (Lasso) encourages sparsity by penalizing the absolute values of coefficients, while L2 regularization (Ridge) penalizes the square of coefficients. By incorporating these regularization techniques, you aim to improve the generalization performance of your regression models and obtain more robust predictions of house prices in the Boston area.
